lo_agent_cls

in meta_agent, call methods with named keywords
agent = MetaAgent(
        state_space=


# move this to inside the environment
add_batch_to_state(env.reset())



env.render(goal_state=goal_state)
pass # remove pass



hi_action_scaling can be defined just once (outside of act)


Do we need this?
goal_broadcast = np.broadcast_to(self.goal, state.shape) #add a batch dimension just in case it's not there
